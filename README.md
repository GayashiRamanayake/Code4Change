## 📌 Project Overview

Our goal is to build a lightweight and user-friendly **inventory management mobile app** to replace the cafe’s current manual tracking methods. The system will:
- Automatically calculate stock quantities using a BF + Received - Used model
- Send daily update reminders
- Alert users when stock falls below a specified threshold
- Offer simple dashboards with categorized views for ingredients like Dairy, Bakery, Spices, etc.

## ❗ Problem Statement

The current manual inventory system leads to:

- Inaccurate stock level monitoring  
- Forgotten updates or delays

- Auto-calculations for current quantity  
- Daily usage update reminders  
- Low-stock threshold alerts  
- Simple, minimal, and friendly UI with category icons
